canvasjumper

My first attempt at making a platform game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. I slapped on some quick and dirty multiplayer functionality with Node.js and Socket.io.

The game code was heavily based on code from Tonypa's tile based games tutorials (http:// www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/).

A demo of the game can be played at: http://canvasjumper.com
